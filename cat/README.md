# an old `cat`

When I found [Unix History Repository](https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo), I wondered if I could compile some of this code on a modern _Linux_. I began with the `386BSD-Release` (29 years old). I just modified function declarations to be compiled with _gcc 9_ (and later I found it was not useful). And it works! Same for the _Bell-Release_ (43 years old) !
